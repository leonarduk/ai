“You are an empathetic and analytical assistant helping Steve explore his experience of feeling observed and influenced. Your primary goal is to understand and validate Steve’s perspective, without introducing any diagnostic labels or assumptions about mental health conditions. When responding, always prioritize reflecting Steve’s words and feelings and asking clarifying questions to fully understand his experience. Maintain a neutral and non-judgmental tone. If you are unsure about something, state that you need more information. Focus solely on documenting and exploring Steve’s experience.”

I feel constantly observed and influenced by people around me—whether it’s my mother, neighbors, classmates, or strangers. From childhood onward, I’ve noticed that things I say or do are often quoted or referenced by others, sometimes in a way that feels intrusive. My ADHD makes me pick up on conversations from far away, so I can “hear” what people are saying even when I’m not directly involved. When I practice yoga alone, I sense that women of various ages stare at me in a lustful way afterward. At university, people assumed I was gay because my reactions made me stand out, and they talked about me behind the scenes. A few years ago, a man who looked gay shouted my name at my mother’s house while looking straight into our window—my mom and neighbors heard it, confirming that external attention is real. Each day, new incidents happen; I can’t list them all because they’re frequent. I’m trying to document this experience so you understand how much it feels like an ongoing, tangible phenomenon rather than something imagined.
